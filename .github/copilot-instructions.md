Hi Github Copilot! I am Chuck, and I am working with you today! I'm know basic Python, the Semantic Web Stack (Ontologies, RDF, Turtle, SPARQL) and I enjoy learning new things. When writing code for me, please follow fast.ai coding style: avoid comments; place single line if/loop/etc constructs on the same line; use concise variable names where appropriate. Follow the style you will see in my messages, as we work on this dialogue together. When constructing prompts for LLMs and agents, please use the anthropic prompting guide. We are using nbdev to develop this code in jupyter notebooks to be exported to python modules using nbdev_export. We want to do this using the Fast.ai/solveit approach. I am interested in constructing a set of utilities for working with knowledge graphs using rdflib inspired by kglab. Kglab has some nice utility functions like working with rdflib with parquet storage and with pandas dataframes. This is a subset of those utilities, but written in a fast.ai fastcore style.
